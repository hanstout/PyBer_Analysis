# PyBer Analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to find the total cost of fares per city per week. Information is provided such as the total number fares, rides, and drivers per city type, the average number of drivers per city type, and the average fares per city type. These city types includes Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas. 
Gathering this information can allow the client to understand where the major of the money being made is coming from, which cities have the most drivers, and other data to help them make decisions about their business. 
## Results: 
After analysis, a few conclusions can be made. Pyber is used most in Urban areas. 
##### Urban cities:
* Have the higest number of rides, 1,625 rides. 
* Have the highest number of drivers, 2,405 drivers. 
* Have the highest total amount of fares, $39,854.38.
* Have the lowest average cost per ride, $24.54.

Because Pyber is used most in Urban cities, it is understandable that the cost per ride is lower than in other city types. The higher number of drivers lowers the demand which could be contibuting to lower average cost per ride. Also, it is safe to assume that in Urban areas, the length of the ride is shorter. 
##### Suburban cities:
The suburban areas have numbers that fall between the ubran areas and rural areas. The are the middle ground between the busy urban cities and the calm rural cities. 
* Total rides: 625
* Total drivers: 490
* Total fares: $19,356.33
* Average cost per ride: $30.97
##### Rural cities: 
* Have the lowest number of rides, 125 rides. 
* Have the lowest number of drivers, 78 drivers. 
* Have the lowest total amount of fares, $4,327.93.
* Have the highest average cost per ride, $34.62.

The data here, again, makes sense with the area and the demand for Pyber. There are less drivers and typically more ground to cover, therefore rides will be more expensive. 

When looking at all city types and weeks throughout the from January to May, around the 3rd week of Febuary and the beginning of April, fares tend to be higher overall, (except for suburban areas where the lowest fares are seen in the first to second week of April).

## Summary: 
Based on the data, I recommend doing a promotion or raising the price of rides in the 2nd or 3rd weeks of March. Around this time is when fares are the lowest, thus bringing in the least amount of money. The middle to end of Febuary is going to be the most profitable so it is important that their enough drivers to meet the demand. Lastly, recommend raising the price in subrban areas in the beginning of April. There is a decline in this area and a slight decline in the other two city types are well. Raising the price would offset loses for that week.
